# RecallLens
RecallLens is an AI assistant that automatically captures, processes, and retrieves key visual and verbal moments from remote meetings, online lectures, and video tutorials. It creates a searchable, multimodal knowledge base—like a “smart memory”—that understands who said what, when, and what was shown on screen.
